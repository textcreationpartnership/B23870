            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap> happen'd to see one, a mauling Piece, if it answers the Title.</p>
            <p>Quest.] <hi>Say you so; Pray what was the Title?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.]</hi> It was <hi>A Refutation of the Atheistical Notion of Fate, or absolute Necessity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If that be it, I have seen it already.</p>
            <p>Quest.] <hi>Well, and what do you think of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.]</hi> I think it doth not answer the Title at all.</p>
            <p>Well then, if you be for <hi>Necessity,</hi> you and I shall differ, for I am for <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, for distinction sake, I shall call you <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Liberty.] <hi>Well,</hi> Necessity, <hi>what have you to say against</hi> Liberty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Necessity.]</hi> I should have had nothing to have said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Liberty,</hi> if the Author had proved that there is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206095:5"/> any such thing; but I have some Remarks to make on his Book; and, first, the Title contains a false Charge.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>Why, what part of the Title is false?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> That the Notion of Fate is atheistical.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>How do yo prove that a false Charge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> The first Article of the Mahumetan Creed saith, I believe that there is but one God; and the sixth saith, That Good and Evil only happen, because God hath fore-ordain'd them, having writ on a Table from all Eternity things that are, and are to be; therefore, all true Mussle-men, and many thousands more, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a God, and that he determines whatever is and shall be, cannot be Atheists, and therefore, such a Notion cannot be the Notion of an Atheist, nor an atheistical Notion.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>But, perhaps he means only, that this Notion will lead Men into Atheism?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> Let him mean what he will, 'tis plain, no Man can be an Atheist, while he is of this Opinion.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>But what do you say to the whole Subject of his Discourse, viz.</hi> That all things are determined by an absolute Fatallity; and, That God himself and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whatsoever are necessary Agents, without having any Power of Choice, or any real Liberty in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> It is an incongruous heap of Stuff, for the first Clause may be true for any thing he hath shewed to the contrary; but that God himself is a necessary Agent (except he have tyed himself to it for his own Pleasure, or the Good of his Creatures) I see no reason to believe; and for the rest of it, it hangs so together, that what both he and I pleads for may be true, for all Creatures may be necessary Agents, and yet have such a real Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in their Natures, as may enable them to Choose; for all Creatures that I can observe, have a Power by, Nature to Choose what is agreeable to their Natures and to do otherwise would be to hate themselves, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:206095:5"/> they cannot do in Thoughts, whatever their Actions may tend to.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>Wherein do you then differ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> To come to the chief Points of Difference; Page the 9th, he quotes <hi>Hobbs,</hi> saying, <hi>That nothing can take beginning from it self, but must do it from the action of some other immediate Agent without it; if therefore a Man have a Will to something which he had not a Will to before, the Cause of his Will is not the Will it self, but somet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing else not in his own disposing.</hi> And Page 11, he saith, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>ant that nothing can take beginning from it self; the Will of Man took beginning from God, and yet it will not in the least follow, that the Cause of a Man's Will is not the Will it self, but something else not in its own Disposing; for he thinks the Acts of the Will take their Original from the faculty of Willing; and that tho' the first Will, or power of Willing, took its beginning from God, yet the Acts of the Will take their Original from that free Power of Election, which God hath placed in our Natures; and therefore we say,</hi> saith he, <hi>that voluntary Actions take their Original,</hi> &amp;c. And Page 14, he saith, <hi>He is properly Free who hath the Power of Determining in himself, and when all Requisits are ready, so that nothing shall extrinsically either hinder from, or compel him to Act; can yet choose whether he will Act or not.</hi> Thus, if a Man hath Pen, Ink, and Paper, and a place to write on, his Hand well, and at liberty, and understands how to Write, he hath all things present that are necessary to produce the Effect of Writing, yet he can nevertheless not produce that Effect, because he can choose after all whether he will Write or no.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>And what can you say to all this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> I allow, That he that hath all Requisites for Action, so that nothing shall either hinder him from, or compel him to Act, and can choose whether he will Act or not, is free from Necessitation. But I deny, 1st, That those Requisites, which he reckons up, are all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206095:6"/> that's requisite. And, 2dly, That when all Requisites are present, he can choose or refuse to Act. I grant, That God hath placed in our Natures a Faculty of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating, and also a Power to Will; but not that this Power to Will, includes all that's requisite in order to Willing, so that where there is one there may be the other.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>Why may not the Power of Willing produce the Acts of Willing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> I shall state the Question so, that the Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof may cut the Thread for ever in this case: The Question is, Whether that general Faculty, or Power, which God at first planted in Human Nature, whereby he enabled Man to Choose, Will and Desire whatever should seem best to him during the whole course of his Life doth include in it, or furnish a Man with whatever is requisite, whereby he may (have Power to Choose, I do not say, for that it doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him with, but) Choose and yet have liberty to Refuse what is set before him.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>You have stated the Question fairly, and I think the case so plain, that you must make a very nice Distinction to evade the Consequences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> I shall make no other Distinction but what your Author made before me; for Page 10. and 13. he blames <hi>Hobbs</hi> for not distinguishing between the <hi>Power</hi> of Willing, and the <hi>Act</hi> of Willing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he shall have enough of it, he shall never need to blame me for confounding 'em together. And first, to shew him that there may be Power to Will, and yet no Act, Choice or Desire, I shall only need to inform him, that by the aforesaid Power, which God planted in our Natures, we have at all times, if we be wakening, a Power to Will in readiness: And then, secondly, I shall leave him to judge whether he can use that Power at any time, but when he hath some occasion, that's not of <hi>his own Procuring, and at his own Disposing:</hi> And,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:206095:6"/> thirdly, if not, what Proof this is that a Power to Will, that lies asleep till it is stirred up, is all that's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, whereby that Power may be put into action; if a Man cannot put those Powers, which God hath planted in his Nature, (whereby he is able to Will, Desire and Choose) into action, unless, besides that Power, there is also some occasion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby it may be moved, then that Power is not a sufficient Cause, nor any Cause at all of a Man's Willing, Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Choosing: But a Man cannot put those Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into action, neither doth any Man do it, without such occasions as are not of his own procuring, and at his own disposing; therefore that Power which God planted in a Man, neither is nor can be the Cause of a Man's Willing, Desiring and Choosing: And what think you now?</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>I think you have shuffled your self from under the strength of this Argument, by bringing in another Cause of Willing,</hi> viz. The Occasions of Willing, <hi>as you call them; but you do not think you have proved an</hi> absolute Necessity?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> No; but if you understand it, you may see that I have proved, That there can be no Liberty from that Argument, because, though we have a Power to Choose, yet that Power cannot be put into Action without something else out of our Power, which that Power doth not <hi>govern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>But he hath more Arguments to prove a Free-will by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> He hath none but what either fall under this, and are disproved by what I have said, or else such as will do him no good; for his Argument, that Pen, Ink, and Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all that's requisite for Writing, is disproved here; for, 'tis <hi>self-evident</hi> to thousands of Men, that have those Requisites, and cannot Write, till they have, besides those which he reckons, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <hi>move</hi> them to it.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>But he proves a Free-will from the use of Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:206095:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> No, but he should have done it in his 7th Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; but doth it follow, that because some Men have the use of Reason <hi>sometimes,</hi> that therefore all Men have it at <hi>all times?</hi> If all Men had the use and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Reason at all times, they would not do Evil; but they do Evil, therefore they have not the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (so as to be said to have a Free-will) at all times by it.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>But he proves Free-will from Page the</hi> 19th, <hi>from the experience of all Mankind, which are conscious of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a free Power of Deliberating in many cases, which way is best for us to proceed, that we can act this way or that way, according as we like best.</hi>

               <hi>Nec.]</hi> This is very true, and one of these Proofs will do him no good, for all Men that I know of, have such a Power of Deliberating, Willing and Choosing; but the word <hi>(Free)</hi> ought to have been left out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, we can forbear to act at all, when we are not <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at all,</hi> yet, when we are moved, that is, when we have <hi>sufficient Occasions,</hi> we are willing, and cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear being so, because that which <hi>disposeth</hi> of our Wills is present.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>Then you own a Will, but not a Free-will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> Yes, and all the Reason in the World, for 'tis not more plain to all Mankind that we have a Will, than it is that our Will doth not <hi>govern it self,</hi> but is govern'd; and that it never <hi>acts,</hi> but when besides it self something else is present to put it into action.</p>
            <p>Again, If Men depend as much on God for their Motions and Opperations as for their Being, then they can do nothing towards those Motions and Opperations, but must depend on their first Cause in all cases as much; and in like manner, as a Sword depends on its Maker, as much for its being a broad, narrow, long or short, good or bad Sword, as for its being a Sword.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> in his <hi>Redemption Redeem'd,</hi> saith, <hi>There is no Created Being, or Second Cause whatever, but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:206095:7"/> depends on the First, which is God; and this as well in the Second as in the First Act,</hi> i. e. <hi>As well in the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Operations issuing from, and performed by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, as in their simple Being and Existence it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let any Man make it intelligible, <hi>How a Man's Actions can be his own, or determined by his own Power and Choice, while this Confession is good and true?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>But there is one Argument I have heard against your Opinion, that is, That though the Will cannot choose without a Motive, yet the Faculties of the Soul in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, can make themselves Motives, and then act by the mediation of these Motives, or make an Object to seem good, and then desire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> If there be any such Power in Man, it must either be the effect of some Mode or State of Body, or some Property of the Soul: If it be the effect of some Mode, it must be natural, and whensoever present, it would of necessity produce or occasion such a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goodness to attend such an Object as would una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably produce a Desire thereof: Thus some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Mode or State of Body, is accompanied with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and Hunger doth unavoidably produce a Desire of Food; but I hope you do not expect Free-will from this Argument. And if the Soul doth <hi>make</hi> those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, whereby those Objects which it Desires, Hopes, Fears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> become desirable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the Soul doth not <hi>depend</hi> on any superior Power for the making those Faculties, by which <hi>only we can know that we have a Soul,</hi> to wit, the Faculties of Hoping, Fearing, Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If the Soul can make an Object to seem good, desirable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when there is no <hi>Reason</hi> why it should seem so before the Soul <hi>makes it seem so,</hi> then the Soul can make the thing not only to <hi>seem good,</hi> but also to <hi>be good</hi> (for, whatever seems good is good) to him, and thereby <hi>governs both the Nature of Men and Things,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:206095:8"/> or the reasonableness of Things being desirable, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or fearful, and so leaves nothing for <hi>God to do with the Minds of Men;</hi> for it must do all, or else it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing at all, it must make the Object to appear good, and yet keep it self at liberty whether it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it or not; for if he hath not Power also to forbear desiring it when he hath made it seem best, he hath catcht himself, as ill as if some other Agent had laid a Necessity on him; if he be independant in making the Object to seem good or bad, without any Cause or Reason at all, and also independant as to any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Desiring when he had made it seem good, then he is equal at least with God, if not above him; but if he can do but one of those Acts, he will still be bound by the other. Again, if the Soul made the desirable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her Objects, and her own Will to desire 'em, 'tis probable he might foresee whether that Desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness would continue or not, and make nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable but what would continue both desirable and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable.</p>
            <p>But there is few of those Objects which she desires that do <hi>continue desirable and attainable,</hi> therefore I will leave any Free-willer to judge whether the Soul doth make the seeming <hi>Goodness</hi> of things, and the <hi>Reasons</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>Again, If it were in the Power of Man to make good things seem good at all <hi>times,</hi> he might for that very Reason (because it would seem one good thing among the rest) make it seem good as well <hi>at one time at at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> to provide and secure himself against what may happen from the four last things, <hi>viz. Heaven, Hell, Death and Judgment,</hi> which are things always alike dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, because <hi>always</hi> alike uncertain as to the time when they may overtake us; but these Considerations have not always such an Effect, and such Impressions on our Minds as it were to be wished they should have, therefore it is not in the Power of Man to <hi>procure Reason</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:206095:8"/> and the exercise thereof, but that it is the effect of Grace, and when Grace hath refined and improved our Nature, good things seem good to us, till then ill things seem good to us, but neither Good nor Ill is made to seem good nor ill <hi>by us,</hi> but to us.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>This seems to take off an Objection, which it brings into my Remembrance, namely, That tho' we have not a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to do Good, yet we have a Free-will to do Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> We have a Will (as I said before, till our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are refined) to do Evil, but here again the word <hi>(Free)</hi> ought to have been left out, because 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that we do not those things out of a Principle of <hi>Freedom</hi> or Liberty, but the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> a State of Slavery, 'tis the Effects of natural Corruption, out of which we are not able to free our selves till God <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines</hi> our Nature, by some means accountable as some <hi>sanctified</hi> Affliction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or some unaccountable way, as the <hi>inward</hi> working of Grace upon our Minds, thereby blunting the edge of our Appetites.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>I think God suffers us to fall by the Corruption of our Wills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> I know not what you can mean less by suffering you to do an ill thing, than by appointing you as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to do it.</p>
            <p>If, First, you grant that God knows the Wills of Men, and can <hi>turn them whether he pleases</hi> (tho' neither you nor I knows how he should do it, if they have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on him,) and if God did not know and could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he suffers, he could not be said to suffer it; and if he knows what will be the event, and yet gives his consent; and for some <hi>Reason, approves and thinks fit to continue them in health and being while they act,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>sustaining</hi> Nature in her due course and vigour, they <hi>could not Act:</hi> And do you think that God would suffer Men thus willingly, or thus willingly suffer them, to will and to do of their own Pleasure, if he had not some end which he thinks fit to carry on thereby?

            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> You must know that in Page the 9th, he had quoted Three or Four of <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Arguments, and some of 'em he had slubbered over slightly, so as not to hurt them, and some of 'em he had left untouch'd, among which was this, <hi>viz.

               <hi>Nec.]</hi> Yes, it doth if you consider it; besides, if you observe carefully the working of your Mind when you deliberate, it will be self-evident, that by how much the seeming goodness of an Object is previous to the desire of that Object, by so much the Necessity of the Will is previous to the Act of Willing; that is, so <hi>long</hi> as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject seems <hi>best and fittest to be chosen, before the Will doth desire it, so long before the Will doth desire that Object it is under a Necessity to desire it.</hi> And, tho' this previousness be short and quick they are grasping at any thing that seems good, yet every Man is conscious, that the <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good</hi> was the <hi>Instrumental Cause of the Choice,</hi> and was therefore so long before it, as to be perceivable; besides, if the Object did not seem best some <hi>time</hi> before the Will did choose it, the Will could not choose or desire it; for the Will always stays to see the seeming bestness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can desire; So that it is clearly made out, that the Will was <hi>necessitated</hi> to make that Determination <hi>à Priori,</hi> and that it could have made no other, because no Agent did occasion or produce a liking of any other.</p>

And 3d, whether this Agent is not wholly out of Man's disposing. And 4th, whether all this doth not amount to a Proof of an absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; that whatever is, must be, and cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; because the Spring of Willing and Acting is not in Man; and therefore whether a Man may not as well choose, whether the Wind shall blow, as choose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than he doth: Nor need I any <hi>Postulata,</hi> nor to gather the strength of my Argument from a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or unproved) Weakness of that of my Adversary's, for instead of saying, (if Man hath the disposing of his own Will, then God cannot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I might have said, 'tis self-evident, to every deserning Man, that the Spring, Source, Motives, and Occasions of Willing, are not procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and dispenced with by his own Power; and that if he sits or lies down, 'tis impossible he can rise again, till something or consideration not of his own procuring comes into his mind, and lays an absolute Necessity on him, which he cannot at that time dispence with; And what Reason have you to believe, that God did or could sore-ordain a Sacrifice for Sin, and not likewise ordain Sin for that Sacrifice to Triumph over?</p>
            <p>And since the seeming Truth of a thing hath the same Effect on the Faculty of believing, that seeming good hath on the Faculty of Willing or Desiring, therefore of the truth of this Notion, I can be as certain, as I can be of my own Being.

            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> Here is one false Consequence built upon another. But let us see, how much of this will vanish by suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God to be a <hi>Free Agent;</hi> and that there is a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Good and Evil, attending the Actions of Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, and that these Things, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and those Actions which by <hi>Means</hi> of the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of Mankind, are <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, have a <hi>Relative Goodness,</hi> that is, they are Good so far as they relate to the <hi>good of Mankind,</hi> and the <hi>Ʋniverse,</hi> and farther than this, <hi>you can see no Good in any thing whatever.</hi> For Instance, For a Man to save the Life of his Father, Mother, Wife, or Child, would be counted a good and reasonable Action; and there is this Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> Because they are Relations that are or may be of use to him; but if he cannot save one of them, but by the loss of his own Life, where lies the Goodness of it then, <hi>is it Naturally, Morally, Eternally, and in it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:206095:14"/> self Good,</hi> for a Man to kill himself, to save another, or to save another by killing himself; and if such an eminent Act of <hi>Charity,</hi> such an Act of <hi>Generosity</hi> may be otherwise than Good, then things are only good by their <hi>Circumstances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, To enquire whether the Evil of things consist in the <hi>Act</hi> or the <hi>Will,</hi> or in neither, let us see whether it would be Evil for a Man to desire to have the use of a Wife, or really to have the use of one: The Answer will be, That it cannot be said, that it either is or is not, unless you have recourse to the Circumstances of the Parties, if the Woman he desires be under the Relation, and Circumstances of a Wife of his own, then 'tis not, otherwise 'tis Evil, because he will thereby become a means to alinate the Mind of the Woman from the Love of her Husband, which he can never restore: Thus you see that things are only <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> by the <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of things; the same thing which differs not, either in the <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Desire,</hi> from another thing which is Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, may be just and honest; to kill another Man in his own Defence, ceases to be Murther, and to save a Man's Life by destroying his own, is made Self-murther, and all this by the Difference of Circumstances only, yet it is to be observed, that these Circumstances are sacred and indispensible by Man, because Man neither made those Circumstances, nor can alter one of them, for the Nature of 'em was settled by God, when he made those Creatures, which have such a Relation to, and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on one another.

            </p>
            <p>I think what I have said takes off all Objections that lies against this Notion, from any Laws <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and therefore I need not take notice of his four or five Pages of Consequents, yet in answer to 'em all, I shall tell him, That if he had but had a grain of Sence, he might have seen that this Doctrine could not be <hi>Mischevious, Pernicious, nor open a Door to any Wickedness,</hi> because it supposes, that none could enter but what was <hi>decreed either from Eternity,</hi> or like time, cut out for us by parcels as we Act it.</p>
            <p>For to suppose that this Doctrine could do any harm to Church or State; were to suppose that the Doctrine it self could dispose of the Wills of Men, which would first destroy <hi>his Notion of Mens Wills, disposing of themselves.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> It would destroy the Doctrine of <hi>Necessity it self,</hi> which supposes Mens Wills to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed off by some Superior Agent. For an Opinion that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:206095:16"/> a Man is Necessitated to Will and Do whatever he doth, neither Necessitates nor Inclines him to Will or Do, because (tho' he confoundes 'em) Believing and Desiring are different Things.</p>
            <p>Thus, if a Man believe that Pampering his Body would be a means to procure Lust, and that Abstinence and a severe course of Diet, would be a means to procure a Sober, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Temper; yet Experience shows, that without some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Occasion (besides the Opinion) to <hi>put</hi> him upon the Use of those Means, he cannot use the Means leading to either of those Ends: So weak and inconsistent is he in his Writing and Disputing, that I would have him to leave it off, and not be so much afraid of losing Time and Pains by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Vertue, and discouraging Vice, because he is but a Man, and therefore knows not when good Advice will be lost, and when not; if therefore he can advise Men to live so as that they may not be afraid to die, he knows not but that God may design Good thereby.</p>
            <p>What I have said to disprove Liberty of Will, will be found Self-evident to all that observe what it is they do, and why they do it. And if these Arguments be demonstrative against a Free-will, then it were better (if it pleased God) that so much of our Sermons, Discourses, and Religious Performances, as are usually spent in declaring and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Free-will, were laid out in (solemnly as at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) confessing that our Help is only in God, and with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, beseech him by his preventing and assisting Grace, to rectifie our Rugged, Revengeful, Lustful, or otherwise Troublesome and Dangerous Inclinations and Appetites: I say, this would be more becoming <hi>Creatures under our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</hi>

               <hi>Nec.]</hi> As to the Productions of Men, the ingenious Mr. <hi>Bently</hi> hath said almost all that can be said, and the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Frame and Texture of Human Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so well fitted for the Ends and Uses for which they serve, is a sufficient Argument to me; that besides the Materials, there was an inteligent Being to dispose those Materials into this Frame, wherein we now see 'em; for if the Earth, or the Chaos, with heat and moisture, could produce A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nimals, Vegitables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When there was neither Eggs, Sperm, nor Seeds, then <hi>dry,</hi> or <hi>calcined</hi> Earth, with Heat
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:206095:17"/> and Moisture, wherein we can be sure, that there is no Eggs, Sperm, nor Seeds, might do it again;</p>
            <p>But I know by Experience, that it cannot do it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude that it never did it.</p>
            <p>Again, if the Chaos could have produced Plants in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Porportion of Men, and that the Motion of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation had been sufficient to <hi>Annimate, Ripen,</hi> and <hi>Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi> 'em from the Ground,</p>
            <p>Then we might <hi>expect</hi> to see some such Effect still, some stately Oak or Elm might come forth, and perform the Exploits of a Giant or <hi>wild Indian,</hi> and other Plants might come forth and Reason together among those of their own sort at least, as well as Brutes; but we never see things happen thus, so that <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion, Heat</hi> and <hi>Moysture,</hi> are not <hi>Sufficient</hi> to produce Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore I conclude, that the Frame and Texture of the Bodies of Annimals, and that Principle that Acts and Annimates them, was the Effect of a Wise and Powerful Being.</p>
            <p>Lib.] <hi>And do you think that our Souls will not die with our Bodies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec.]</hi> If that thinking Faculty which Annimates our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do not <hi>Waste</hi> and <hi>Decline</hi> as our Bodies do; but that generally this Faculty grows, is improved and inlarged in its Notions and Apprehensions of things, as the Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, and many times the Declension of one, is the Growth and Increase of the other, as is seen by Mens <hi>Desires, Hopes and Fears growing more Vigorous and Intense,</hi> when the State of the Body is so Impaired, as not to be able to make known its Thoughts, by Words and Actions as before, but only by Signs, then 'tis probable our Souls are more than a Temperament of Body, and do not depend on it for their Beings, but will exist after the Dissolution of our Bodies, and be Immortal.</p>
            <p>And since we cannot Act without a Motive, I wish this consideration of our Souls, out living our Bodies, may prove one, and that God would be pleased to set it forward, so that thereby we may provide against the worst (and then we shall be prepared for the best) <hi>that a future State can bring with it.</hi>
